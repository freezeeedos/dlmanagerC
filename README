Dlmanager
=========

Download manager written in C/LibCURL. It opens a file in a text editor, and downloads the links you paste in it.

I won't try to make everything work right away, I use the program everyday, and do my best to fix problems as they come.
If you like this program, feel free to report bugs at freezeeedos(at)gmail.com .
And if you think my code is complete crap, you can also tell me. But you have to tell me why.
