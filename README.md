Dlmanager
========
Download manager written in C/LibCURL. It opens a file in a text editor, and downloads the links you paste in it.

I won't try to make everything work right away, I use the program everyday, and do my best to fix problems as they come.
If you like this program, feel free to report bugs at freezeeedos(at)gmail.com .
And if you think my code is complete crap, you can also tell me. But you have to tell me why.

Sample Output:

    Getting 'winpe.iso':
    100%  112.8/112.8 mB        112 mB/s        
    Getting 'elementaryos-beta2-amd64.20130506.iso':
    100%  680.0/680.0 mB         61 mB/s
**Note**: the reason for such high speed is because I was transferring local files (curl supports the file:// protocol)
